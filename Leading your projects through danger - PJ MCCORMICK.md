# PJ McCormick - Leading your projects through danger

@mynameispj

- Amazon creative services
- Whiteboarding/sketches/mockups less important than collaboration
- Invited clients into process - cut down on churn
- HElped them understand what design is - figuring out the problem
- Mock-up is the consequence 

## Working across teams
- Amazon massive collection o teams
Even th emost challenging clients are not acting this way as stupid or being difficult - it comes from a place of fear
-  FEar is not bad but basing decisions on it is
- Absence of a leader

## LEaders are not:

- Bosses
- Manager
- Official authority figures

## Leaders don't always:
- have the right answers
- Have the best skills

## 2 things leaders do:
1. Listen
2. Build confidence and trust

"People who were right a lot are people who often change their minds"

## Feedback
I hate it so much > I hate sticky elements > I hate poorly done sticky elements
- I hate it > I am scared > I am accountable . Its my head on a block

LEading your people through projects

"Tell me more aboutâ€¦"
- "why you hate it/want the logo bigger/etc"
