## Design is fun 
- profitable and cool and scary and annoying
## Designgenerring my way
- At the beginning obscurityy can be a good thing. You want attention only after you're doing great work
## Path to Dribbble
- I had to be part of ut somehow for the taste of success and beyond
## Mash em loke a pro
- Just connect the dots and make people really mad at you
## Desing what you need
- Fake it tip you make it
## Be nice
- The world is a small town
