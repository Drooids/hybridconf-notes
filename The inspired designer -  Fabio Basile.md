# THE INSPIRED DESIGNER - Fabio Basile

@ffabs

## Design is fun 
and profitable and cool and scary and annoying

## Designgenerring my way
At the beginning obscurity can be a good thing. You want attention only after you're doing great work

## Path to Dribbble
I had to be part of it somehow for the taste of success and beyond

## Mash em like a pro
Just connect the dots and make people really mad at you

## Design what you need
Fake it tip you make it

## Be nice
The world is a small town
