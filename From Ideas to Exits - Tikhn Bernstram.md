# From ideas to exits - Tikhon Bernstram

## Myth
- The genius idea
- Scribd was their 12th(ish) App
- Parse had 15 landing pages

## Markets

1. Solve your own problems
- OK, but not great in our industry as devs are tight, makes dev tools difficult sell
2. BE x for y (eg. Youtube for Docs)
3. Growing markets
4. Large market, fragmented == poor products. Good opportunity

## "Don't be scared of being 2nd to market" 
- Let others go first and get it wrong
- learn from their mistakes

## Plan to exist not exit
- Can be difficult to exit
- Lots of exits end badly
- lots of deals fall through at last minute
- "Some of the most unhappy people I know sold up"
- If you love something and are proud of it why give it up - ight not be best idea
