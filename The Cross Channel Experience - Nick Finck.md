## Customers don't think in context of channels
- If one channel is missing make  the company seem incomplete

## Methods

- Observe how people use it 
-- NO surveys,. Get first hand empirical research
-- Hat customer may tell you is very removed from first hand observation
- Observe in context of use
-- Kinect example
-- USA waving compared Japan waving to turn on
-- Physical space of users room
- Attention to detail counts
- Look for hacks
- Follow the whole engagement
-- How employees work
-- Notice differences in setups

## Tools
- Audience element (the people)
- Onstage experience element (the site/the packaging/ the store/ Customer service staff)
- Backstage (Parts that are not exposed to the customer - eg. behind the door at the apples tore)
- Th support process and systems (database, web server - not necessarily accessed by customer)
- Experience map
- Service blueprint

## Examples
- UBER
