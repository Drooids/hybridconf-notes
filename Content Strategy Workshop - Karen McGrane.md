# Content Strategy Workshop - Karen McGrane

## Common issues
- We'll deal with it later
- Content generally not part of most design processes or if it is its an add on at the end

## Anecdote about project
- Full new templates and design but same content.
- Stakeholders all very unhappy y with ne site (as new design made poor quality content obvious)
- Ended up rolling the site back and creating new content

## "Not taking content as seriously as design, UX, IA, is like giving a beautifully wrapped, but empty box for Christmas"

## Exercise - Issues you've faced when content not part of process

- Waiting for it, then having changes
- making *ALL THE THINGS* CMS editable
- Trying to build empty vessels which can contain anything and everything
- varying levels of content owners - all with different ideas of what good content is

### CMS swing from very rigid editable content to editing everything and total control
- User permissions and roles will become very important
- Project manage content

## Always ask why!
- when a customer/client comes to you asking for something, very important to ask why they think they need it, who told them they need it.
"An RFP is a cry for help" Mike Monteiro

- Brand + Design are both Content

## Most important challenge for our industry is understanding we are not the user!

## Use The Robots!

## Content Modelling
- Not content then design, content or design, design then contentâ€¦ Content *and* design - Mark BOulton

- Well organised system of content types, attributes and data types

### Type 
- an article, product spec, recipe

### what Fields or Attributes need to be entered
- 250 word intro
- 1 - 3 images
- optional video

### What limits on fields
- Date format
- acceptable image size and formats

## Tumblr Content Model
- Word press is classic "Blob" CMS. 
- Add any content from HTML/Images/video all in same field
- Tumblr Content types carefully considered and provided
- Allow in context guidance fo ruser
this allows more control on front end
- makes easier for user without losing control (blob method still available)

## CMS needs to be treated like a product in and of itself
- As important UX project as the front end
- Tagging of items should be handled though built in taxonomy to keep this meta data useful/relevant. (Could be automated)

## Someone news to own your content strategy

# Content Strategy for Mobile

## 4 Key things
1. Content matters on mobile
2. Strive for content parity
- Thi sis complex though. In most cases 80 should probably be the same but some cases where not possible (example complex data tables). In these case different but equivalent content should be provided
3. Its not strategy if you can't maintain it
4. You don't get to decide what device people use - they do!

## Stats
86% use phone while watching TV (Google/Nielsen)

30% Restaurant searches come from mobile (Google)

60% Use phone to "pre-shop" (Google)
33% use phone whilst in store (Google)

15% of searches for financial content from mobile (pretty average standard amount)

Some of this is generational. Young people will see desktop computers the way we see landline phones, VHS' etc. this will be parent technology

62% 18-24 have a smart phone
50% teens rarely use a desktop

## Consider how people will use multiple devices to complete a task and the flow they will go through

## "PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT ON MOBILE" > "SOMEBODY ALREADY WANTS TO DO IT ON MOBILE"

- Generally/anecdotal from Karen's experience if your total traffic is 10% mobile before mobile optimisation it will be 20% after making a mobile optimised site
- You can't predict future behaviour from a current experience that sucks

## "Screen size is not context
- 79% of google searches on mobile happen at home or work

## The long tail of content
The 20 least viewed pages might get more pages views (combined) than th stop 5 pages yoou choose to make available on mobile

- *Don't second guess what people will want*
- Editorial process, workflow and governance will need to change

## NPR approach to mobile content
- COPE (Create once publish everywhere)
- chunked CMS
- meta data
3rd party content
- All fed into API 
- makes it easier for various devices applications to consume and display the content
## TV Guide (1980s)
- realised they were in the content business - not the publishing/print business
- made sure their program descriptions included short med and long descriptions, as well as meta data (actors, genre, runtime etc)
- This data is now used in electronic program guides/TIVO etc
- used in ways unconceived of when they put system in place

## 3 principles
1. Multiple sizes
2. Meaningful meta data
3. Written for reuse

## Why are news organisations leading the way in mobile/responsive
- they already have structured content - taught to structure written articles at journalism school
- Hed
- Dek
- Nutgraf
- lede
- photo
- caption
- cutlines

## Traditional publishing paradigms tie content to display to delivery
- Preview button on CMS is generally displays a desktop view
- What is the primary platform? There isn't one
- Design for the content out (not specific content but types of content)

## Design your content!
1. ### Reusable content
Example: Amazon Mobile Details page
-- Great on desktop. Mobile kinda sucks
Better use:
-- Multiple versions (like TV Guide)
-- Alternative fallbacks 

2. ### Structures content
More like NPR/Tumlbr > Less like Wordpress
*Chunks not Blobs*

3. ### Presentation independent markup
> Try and remove the chocolate from an M&M
> @lyzadanger

TV Guide example

4. ### Meaningful meta data
> Metadata is like a love letter to the future
> @textfiles

5. ### Usable CMS
> Most CMS were designed ro ad an interface to a database 
>@eaton

CMS workflow should be treated like a checkout workflow - USe same user testing, research, conversions etc

> The happier people are, the better the content will be, the more they will create

## Use mobile as a wedge to improve content management
- Separate content from display
- Design with and for structured content
