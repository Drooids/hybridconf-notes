# Julie Ann Horvath - Open source is awesome

@nrrrdcore

## All front end code is open source by fault
- the web is open by default
- very open community

## Design not so open
"Developers are more open contribute code and discuss about bettering each other while designers seem secretive ego filled and seeking pointless exclusivity"

- We're all making software

## Misconceptions

### Open source != giving away work for free
- http://choosealicense.org
- Don't give away anything that pays your rent
- Open source is a great watt build a portfolio
- Companies care that you ship something. Not the box shadow

### You have to be a hardcore dev to contribute to open source
- boxen.github.com
- hubot.github.com

### OPen source is hard
- "Github is hell bent on lowering the barrier to contribute to open source projects"
- bootstrap	
- You don't need to build a framework	
- Join a conversation
- Provide feedback on a pull request
- jump in when you're ready
- Github pages

## 3rd Law of Github
- If you put something out here, someone will take it and make it better and create a feedback loop of awesome
- Fork N Go
- sheetsee.js - use googledocs as your DB @jllord - link with google forms
- A big part of open source is allowing designers to be self sufficient

## Open source helps you Work with developers
- YOu a learn lot from emersion

## Open source helps you leave tour comfort zone
- There is no such thing as a secret sauce when it comes to the web

"Lets start making the web better for each other"
