### 4 Design principles

#### Choosing and pairing
2 fonts is usually enough
Keep it in the family
opposites attract
avoid two fonts with a lot ov personalty

- Visual Hierarchy
Maintianing order of *OBJECTS*
Negative space
Gestalt principles of perception (How we perceive the world in complete objects) (Andy Rutledge site has series on these)
### Similarity

### Continuation 
-- 
### Closure
Inkomplette objects put together to create a complete object
### PRoximity
-- Objects near one another we perceive them to belong together

- proportion	
One size of an object effects other sized objects 
-- The key to beauty
-- Grids
-- golden ratio / 3:4 ratio / 2:3 ratio
-- GRidset

- Colour 
-- Color is difficult
### Choosing coloyrs
-- Warm/Bright/Dark
