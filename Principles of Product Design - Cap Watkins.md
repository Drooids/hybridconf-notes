- ## Be a *product* designer
-- Design isn't just the how. Its the what. The when. The why
-- Get design involved early
-- Write out problems and tenets before stating a project
-- This frames ht e discussion
-- Small teams
-- Ask Questions
-- Are we still solving gthe right problem?
-- Does this still make sense to do

- ## NO Silos
-- Designers are at a distinct advantage - can see across the whole product
-- Its in our nature to think holistically

- ## Share all the time
-- ITS DANGEROUS TO GO ALNE
-- Designers work in different ways
-- PRocess should be transparent
-- Surprise the number on problem at organisations
-
- ## Celebrate Failure
-- Perfection is pursuit
-- Two approaches
1. Design/dev/measure
2. Short. iterative. measurable. 
-- Ship often
-- Allows you to to screw up
-- Accept design s are imperfect
-- willing to fail to learn

- ## All principles subject to change
"If it doesn't work, we'll try something else. If it does work, eventually it'll break and we'll try something else"
